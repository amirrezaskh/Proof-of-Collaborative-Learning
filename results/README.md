## Key Findings

### System Performance

#### Training Convergence
The PoCL system demonstrates:
- **Stable Convergence**: Models converge within 10-20 epochs per round
- **Consistent Performance**: Validation accuracy maintains 70-80% range
- **Federated Benefits**: Global model improves through collaborative learning

#### Winner Selection Effectiveness
- **Fair Distribution**: Winners are distributed across miners based on performance
- **Performance Correlation**: Better data quality leads to higher winning probability
- **Incentive Alignment**: Reward system encourages honest participation

#### Consensus Mechanism
- **Democratic Process**: Voting-based winner selection ensures fairness
- **Byzantine Tolerance**: System resilient to up to 1/3 malicious participants
- **Transparent Governance**: All votes recorded on immutable blockchain

### Data Heterogeneity Impact

#### Data Size Correlation
Analysis shows relationship between local data size and winning frequency:
- **Larger Datasets**: Generally lead to better model performance
- **Quality vs Quantity**: Data quality sometimes outweighs quantity
- **Diminishing Returns**: Extremely large datasets don't guarantee wins

#### Distribution Strategies
Two data distribution strategies tested:
1. **Decreasing Distribution**: `[(10-i)/55 for i in range(10)]`
2. **Grouped Distribution**: `[((i//5)*3+1)/25 for i in range(10)]`

Results show grouped distribution provides more balanced participation.

### Attack Resistance

#### KNN Attack Analysis
- **Attack Scenario**: Adversarial miners using KNN instead of deep learning
- **Detection**: Voting mechanism identifies poor-performing attackers
- **Mitigation**: Attackers consistently rank low and receive minimal rewards
- **System Robustness**: Honest miners maintain consensus despite attacks

## Generating Results

### Training Metrics Analysis
Run the analysis scripts in the miner directory:
```bash
cd clients/miner
python3 training_results.py    # Generate training performance plots
python3 datasize_winners.py    # Analyze data size vs winning correlation
```

### Custom Analysis
Access stored training data for custom analysis:
```python
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load training history for specific miner and round
with open('clients/miner/results/miner_1_round_5.json', 'r') as f:
    history = json.load(f)

# Plot training curves
plt.plot(history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Performance Metrics

### System-wide Metrics
- **Average Training Time**: 2-3 minutes per round
- **Consensus Time**: ~30 seconds (training + prediction + voting)
- **Winner Selection**: Top 5 out of 10 miners per round
- **Total Rounds**: 20 rounds per experiment

### Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy**: 80-90% typical range
- **Validation Accuracy**: 70-80% typical range
- **Convergence Rate**: 10-15 epochs average
- **Model Size**: ~2.5MB per trained model

### Consensus Metrics
- **Participation Rate**: 90-100% miners participate in voting
- **Winner Consistency**: 60-70% overlap between consecutive rounds
- **Reward Distribution**: Proportional to model contribution significance
- **Attack Detection**: 100% detection rate for KNN attacks

## Research Insights

### Federated Learning Effectiveness
1. **Collaborative Improvement**: Global model performance exceeds individual local models
2. **Privacy Preservation**: Local data never leaves miner premises
3. **Incentive Compatibility**: Reward system encourages honest participation
4. **Scalability**: System handles 10 miners efficiently, extensible to more

### Blockchain Integration Benefits
1. **Transparency**: All training rounds and decisions are publicly auditable
2. **Immutability**: Historical performance data cannot be tampered with
3. **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
4. **Trust**: Cryptographic verification ensures data integrity

### Consensus Mechanism Advantages
1. **Democratic**: Each miner has equal voting weight
2. **Performance-based**: Rewards correlate with contribution quality
3. **Byzantine Tolerant**: Resilient to malicious participants
4. **Efficient**: Fast consensus without energy-intensive mining

## Experimental Configurations

### Standard Configuration
- **Miners**: 10 participants
- **Data**: CIFAR-10 dataset (heterogeneous distribution)
